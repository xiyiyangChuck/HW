    "A hypothesis is a testable idea that you can evaluate with data. The key factor that makes an idea testable is whether it can be measured or quantified. For example, saying \"apples are expensive\" isn't testable, but \"apples cost more than $1.75 per pound\" is because it has a clear value. A good null hypothesis is one that's specific, measurable, and represents no effect or no difference, like \"the average salary is $50,000.\" The null hypothesis assumes no change, while the alternative hypothesis suggests a difference or effect that you're trying to prove."
