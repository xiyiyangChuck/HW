We also discussed summary statistics provided by df.describe(), which includes count, mean, std, and more, and how df.describe() handles missing values by ignoring them when computing statistics. Additionally, we briefly touched on how to remove missing data using df.dropna().\n",
    "\n",
    "2. GroupBy Operations in Pandas\n",
    "We explored the function df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe() and how it produces summary statistics for column col2 within each group defined by col1. We compared the count values generated by df.describe() and df.groupby(), noting that:\n",
    "\n",
    "df.describe() gives summary statistics across the whole DataFrame, including the count of non-null values for each column.\n",
    "df.groupby() provides the count of non-null values for each group defined by col1.\n",
    "3. Intentional Errors and Troubleshooting\n",
    "To compare troubleshooting via a ChatBot session versus using Google search, we introduced several common coding errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Forgetting to import Pandas (NameError: name 'pd' is not defined)\n",
    "Mistyping a CSV file name (FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory)\n",
    "Using a DataFrame before assignment (AttributeError)\n",
    "Missing parentheses (SyntaxError)\n",
    "Mistyping method names (AttributeError)\n",
    "Using incorrect column names (KeyError)\n",
    "Forgetting to put column names in quotes (NameError)\n",
    "We discussed how both a ChatBot and Google search provide similar solutions, though the ChatBot offers more interactive, step-by-step guidance, making it potentially more useful for learning or immediate fixes. Google search tends to be better for more detailed documentation and broader issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Comparing ChatBot vs. Google Search for Troubleshooting\n",
    "For each error, we compared troubleshooting via a ChatBot session and a Google search, concluding that:\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple syntax errors (e.g., missing imports, method typos) are equally easy to resolve using both tools.\n",
    "More complex errors (e.g., debugging file paths or column names) may benefit from the ChatBot's more interactive, context-aware suggestions.\n",
    "Overall, both methods are effective, but the ChatBot can offer a faster and more hands-on experience for fixing immediate issues."
